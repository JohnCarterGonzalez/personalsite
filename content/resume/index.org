** Projects
*** Turbo Rails Gem Clone
Description: A replica of the turbo-rails gem, developed with a strategic purpose to gain an understanding of the inner workings of Hotwire.js technology. This project was undertaken to provide comprehensive insights to our business leadership, facilitating well-informed decisions. This project demonstrates proficiency in Ruby 3.2.2, Ruby on Rails 7.0.4, and ESM shims. In my personal capacity, I dedicated significant time to dissect the turbo-rails gem and comprehensively explore its implementation life-cycle. This project also utilizes Test Driven Development code with a 100% test coverage. This project also includes comprehensive installation and usage instructions, available on GitHub: Turbo Rails Gem Clone.


*** myTorrent
Description: myTorrent represents a BitTorrent client, a peer-to-peer protocol for file sharing, characterized by its utilization of the Bencode encoding. Bencode, a serialization format integral to the BitTorrent protocol, makes up the core functionality of this project. The project serves the dual purpose of addressing professional requirements and personal preferences, catering to server-based file-sharing needs. It encompasses crucial components, including HTTP tracking, BitTorrent Protocol, and pipelining. This project relies on Python 3.10.12, Pytest, and Pylint.. For further insights into myTorrent, please visit the project on GitHub: myTorrent.

*** Tcp-Async-Tokio
Description: Tcp-Async-Tokio, affectionately named the "Redis-lite" project, was conceptualized and developed as a result of an extensive professional engagement with Redis. The project's primary objective is to attain an advanced comprehension of TCP and the Redis protocol. It features the implementation of essential functions, such as the "Ping/Pong" request/response cycle, as well as echo and GET/SET response cycles. The project demonstrates a fusion of imperative and declarative coding styles, engineered in Rust. A commitment to coding principles is evident through a DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) approach, rigorous 100% test-driven development (TDD), and adherence to Conventional Commit and Git strategies. This project depends on Rust,, and rustc 1.73.0 . For further details and exploration, please visit the project on GitHub: Tcp-Async-Tokio.
